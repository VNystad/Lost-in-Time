2811a5e Martin Bråten                 2016-12-15 Martins second last push? Made it so that the playeranimation for all flipped playeranimations are displayed using the same frame so if a player were to turn, it will have the same pose. When falling, the player will display falling animation, and jumping animation when jumping, and then falling. This is done using variables and the same functions as before. Killing monkeys now awards bonus points: 25 for kill, 100 for making it fall out of the map. Disabled save and load. Added sound effect for menu choices. There is a bug if one were to change option very quickly in the esc menu, but it would most likely not be a problem in release
